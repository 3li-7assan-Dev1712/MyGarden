<h1>Plant to make it Green!</h1>
A garden application. Using the app a farmer can stay memorized about weather they watered their plants or not,
The idea of the app is that the farmer choose a plant to plant, then the app will count the age, and last watered time.
Using these two information the farmer can track their plants age and water them in the convenient time.
And with the help of widgets the farmer doesn't need to open the app, Just from the home screen!.
